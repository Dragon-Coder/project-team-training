# project-team-training
This is the First Project for the Project Team Training

Tasks:
We are going to design a tool that will take in a "json" object containing keywords and display to the screen correctly, styled, and maybe some functionality.

Kelsey:
Handling HTML and formatting (UX) for the site

Lief:
Handle the functionality with the browser

THE RULES!!!
Kelsey is the ONLY one that can touch HTML code
Lief is the ONLY one that can touch JS code

BOTH CAN MODIFY CSS FILES. (NO INLINE STYLING ALLOWED)

REQUIREMENTS

We will go over the style of this tool but it should be similar to other apps. The goal will be to handle different functions over time from the same tool. We will need a layout of the tool along with displaying pretty data.

We also need a way of getting this data and giving it to the browser.
